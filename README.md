Pig Latin  – is a joke language that makes regular words hard to understand. Let me give you some examples to better understand
what is that we’re trying to do here.

Lets say we have a word “pig” and the word that come out of it would be “igpay”. “Happy” which would become “appyhay”.
Or “duck” -> “uckday”. I hope you can see where I’m going with this. If it starts with the consonant or consonant cluster – you take
it (the single consonsnt or the cluster) and move it to the end and “ay (pig -> igpay or glove->oveglay). But if the word starts vowel
then you siply add “yay” to the end, like apple -> appleyay.
This program is going to ask the user to enter a sentence, and then it will convert the sentence into the Pig Latin. Cool, right?
